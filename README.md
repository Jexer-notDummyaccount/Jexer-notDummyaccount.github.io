## 💡 Why I Made This

Because the internet needs more color, fun, and **web pages that feel alive**.  
This project is my **digital playground** – a space to show off my creativity, skills, and a hint of personality.  

Whether you're here to **get inspired**, **steal some code**, or just **admire the gradients** – welcome 💜

---

## 🎨 Design Goals

- Use **vibrant gradients** like it's 1999 💅
- Keep it **interactive and engaging**
- Make HTML/CSS feel like art
- Keep everything ✨ aesthetic ✨

---

## 🛠 Behind the Pixels (Tech Stack)

- **HTML5** – classic, clean structure  
- **CSS3** – fancy gradients and flexbox magic  
- **Google Fonts** – `Quicksand` for that smooth look  
- *(Optional JavaScript coming soon...)*
